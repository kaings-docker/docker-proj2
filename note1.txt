// docker networks: DNS
// example1) create 2 nginx containers & execute ping command frm nginx1 to nginx2 using custom network (bridge driver, with built-in DNS server)
// when we create new network "nginxnet" (bridge), it will automatically has DNS server built into it unlike default "bridge" network.
// default "bridge" network does not have DNS server built in it, which is why without manually connect the containers to our custom network "nginxnet",
// we could not let containers to communicate with each other (using default "bridge" network, we CANNOT execute `docker container exec nginx1 ping nginx2`. 
// Therefore, we use "nginxnet" which uses "bridge" driver)
docker container run -d --name nginx1 nginx
docker container run -d --name nginx2 nginx
docker network create --driver bridge nginxnet  ... create new network named "nginxnet" using bridge driver (default is bridge)
docker network connect nginxnet nginx1          ... container name "nginx1" is also the container DNS now   
docker network connect nginxnet nginx2          ... container name "nginx2" is also the container DNS now

docker container exec nginx1 ping nginx2 
docker container exec nginx2 ping nginx1

docker container exec -it nginx1 ping nginx2    ... since now nginx1 & nginx2 is in same network, they can communicate with each other!
docker container exec -it nginx2 ping nginx1        ** using default bridge network (no DNS server built-in), this WONT work!
                                                    ** the work around of this is by using `--link` flag to link nginx1 & nginx2 (see example2 below)


// example2) create 2 nginx containers & execute ping command frm nginx1 to nginx2 using default bridge network (NO built-in DNS server)
// since default bridge network does NOT have DNS server built-in, we need to use `--link` flag to establish connection between containers

// example3) DNS Round Robin
// in docker container run command, using flag `--network-alias` it means: 
// I want another DNS alias to call this container by (besides its container name which is also its DNS)
// Since we use `--network-alias`, we do NOT need to name the containers, we are just gonna use the network-alias.
// Every request comes to the defined network-alias will be forwarded to either one of the containers (they all have same network-alias, sanme DNS so to say)
// which makes DNS round robin possible.
// in this example, we use `nslookup`. nslookup (name server lookup) is a tool used to perform DNS lookups in Linux

// Using Prune to Keep Your Docker System Clean (YouTube)
You can use "prune" commands to clean up images, volumes, build cache, and containers. Examples include:
- `docker image prune` to clean up just "dangling" images
- `docker system prune` will clean up everything
- The big one is usually `docker image prune -a` which will remove all images you're not using. 
  Use `docker system df` to see space usage.

Remember each one of those commands has options you can learn with --help.
Here's a YouTube video I made about it: https://youtu.be/_4QzP7uwtvI
Lastly, realize that if you're using Docker Toolbox, the Linux VM won't auto-shrink. 
You'll need to delete it and re-create (make sure anything in docker containers or volumes are backed up). 
You can recreate the toolbox default VM with `docker-machine rm default` and then `docker-machine create`

// docker stack (something like docker compose. But, docker stack is for swarm only while docker compose is for local development which only focus on single container)

//   Because docker stack can be use for PROD. In PROD, we do NOT build, we only perform 'build' for local development 
//   (logical explanation why docker stack don't recognize 'build')
// - docker compose is for single container local development only. It recognize 'build' but not 'deploy'.
//   'deploy' is for docker swarm only (PROD ready environment)

// docker swarm: using secret in docker swarm
// docker swarm enables 'secret' (encrypted secret storage using ramfs) for storing secret
// we can use docker swarm yaml that has 'secret' in local docker-compose as well. But, since the real 'secret' (ramfs-based secret) 
// is only available in docker swarm, in docker-compose local development, 'secret' will be a fake secret (file-based secret) which 
// is docker compose work around.
// location of the docker secret 'secret' (both real-docker-swarm & fake-local-docker-compose): /run/secrets/<secret-name>


// create 2 secrets using docker secret (docker swarm - not local/docker-compose):
// 1) create secret from a file with some content (secret name is the name you give when creating the secret, its content will be the value of the secret)
//    1)-1 create a txt file with content
           echo "mypsqluser" 1> psql_user.txt
           ls
           cat psql_user.txt

//    1)-2 create docker swarm secret using the text file
//         (create secret with the secret name 'psql_user', the value is the file content which is 'mypsqluser'. 
//          But, docker swarm encrypted the value. The value only can be seen by the containers that it is assigned to)
           docker secret create psql_user psql_user.txt

// 2) create secret directly using standard input
      // the `-` tells the script to read the input from standard input which in this case is 'myDBpassWORD'
      echo "myDBpassWORD" | docker secret create psql_pass -


// both of these secret 'psql_user' & 'psql_pass' are encrypted. Their value/content is ONLY exposed to the container(s)
// they are assigned to. You can inspect them `docker secret inspect psql_user` & `docker secret inspect psql_pass`.
// But, you wont be able to see the content.

// Although it is encrypted this way, the above 2 ways of generating secret is NOT RECOMMENDED as they have their drawback in security.
// method 1) security drawback:
// since the file used to generate secret is created & stored in the host server, it is NOT SAFE.
// Recommended way is to create the file locally & pass it to remote host in more secure way (SCP, FTP, etc)
//
// method 2) security drawback:
// we generate secret using bash command standard input `echo`. For those who has the root access of the host,
// can easily check the bash history to get what we have echoed `history` command.

// to list all the created secrets
// ps: both secrets are stored at `/run/secrets/psql_user` & `/run/secrets/psql_pass`
