## Service Updates: Changing Things In Flight

docker service create -p 8088:80 --name web nginx:1.13.7

docker service ls

docker service scale web=5                                      ... increase replicas to 5 on the fly

docker service update --image nginx:1.13.6 web                  ... it does NOT matter if it is older image. The point is "IT HAS TO BE DIFFERENT THAN CURRENT IMAGE"

docker service update --publish-rm 8088 --publish-add 9090:80   ... change publish port (remove the old & add new one at the same time)

docker service update --force web                               ... when we change number of nodes or move things around, we might find out that some nodes are "lighter" or "emptier" than others.
                                                                    It is because docker swarm does not do auto-rebalancing of the nodes. So it might be some node balance issue
                                                                    as some nodes will work harder than others.
                                                                    TIPS: 
                                                                    since docker swarm do NOT do auto-rebalancing, we can force update of service even nothing to update.
                                                                    `docker service update --force [service-name]`
                                                                    This command will force reissue/recreate of the tasks of nodes, which indirectly will auto-balance the tasks to
                                                                    all of the nodes because docker swarm will reissue/recreate tasks starting frm lighter nodes
